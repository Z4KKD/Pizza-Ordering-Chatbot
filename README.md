# Pizza Ordering System

This Python script serves as a virtual assistant to help users order pizza. It prompts users for various details regarding their pizza preferences, calculates the total cost of the order, and provides an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for the order. Additionally, it offers rewards based on the total cost of the order.
